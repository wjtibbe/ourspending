# Tests

No build step and no dependencies: these run the exact `.ts` modules the Edge
Functions import, using Node's native type stripping (Node 22.6+).

    node --experimental-strip-types tests/categories.test.ts
    node --experimental-strip-types tests/sync.test.ts

`categories.test.ts` covers the mapping layer: multilingual aliases, MCC codes,
resolution priority, deactivated household categories, and the guarantee that
an unknown value always lands on an existing app category rather than inventing
one.

`sync.test.ts` drives `_shared/sync.ts` — the same core used by both the hourly
cron job and the "Sync now" button — against a fake PostgREST and a fake Wise
API. It covers idempotency, the pending/reversed/cancelled/declined/failed and
incoming skips, the balance-vs-merchant amount choice under currency
conversion, and isolation of a failing transaction or a failing connection.

## Database-level verification

Run in the Supabase SQL editor. Each wraps itself in a transaction that ends in
`ROLLBACK`, so production data is never modified.
